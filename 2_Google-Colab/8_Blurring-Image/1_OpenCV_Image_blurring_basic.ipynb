        " \n",
        " - Gaussian blur is the result of blurring an image by a **Gaussian function**. \n",
        " \n",
        " - It is a widely used effect in **graphics software**, typically to **reduce image noise and reduce detail**.\n",
        " \n",
        " - It is also used as a **preprocessing** stage before applying our **machine learning or deep learning models.**\n",

        "\n",
        " - The Median Filter is a non-linear digital filtering technique, often used to **remove noise** from an **image or signal**.\n",
        " \n",
        " - Median filtering is very widely used in **digital image processing** because, under certain conditions, it preserves edges while removing noise.\n",

        " - It is one of the best algorithms to remove Salt and pepper noise.\n",

        "- **Bilateral Blur:**\n",
        "\n",
        " -  A bilateral filter is a non-linear, edge-preserving, and noise-reducing smoothing filter for images.\n",
        " \n",
        " - It replaces the **intensity of each pixel** with a weighted average of intensity values from nearby pixels.\n",
        " \n",
        " - This weight can be based on a Gaussian distribution. Thus, sharp edges are preserved while discarding the weak ones."
